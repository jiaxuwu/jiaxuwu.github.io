We have mentioned before that developing the clubroot resistance (CR) canola cultivar is one of the best management strategies. Canola growers in Canada rely on different
genetic resistance resources to ensure the yield under pressure from emergence of novel pathotyoes of clubroot pathogen. Since the first CR canola cultivar has been introduced in Canada, there are more than 60 cultivars by different seed companies in 2022.
In this blog, we are going to explore the history of different generations CR cultivars.

## First generation clubroot resistance  

The first CR cultivar named "45H29" and was developed by Pioneer in 2009, which carries one of the CR genes from the European resistance resource cv. Mendel. Subsequently, more resistant cultivars has 


## Second generation clubroot resistance

However, the pathogen Plasmodiophora brassicae continues to evolve putting the resistance of even these cultivars at risk.
