My name is **Jiaxu Wu**, and now I am a PhD student of plant biology at Université Laval, Quebec, Canada. My current focuses on understanding the clubroot resistance in canola through a multidisciplinary approaches that encompasses genetics, biochemistry, and bioinformatics. Our primary objective is to assist the Canadian canola industry in effectively managing clubroot disease while maintaining sustainability. 
On this website, I will provide regular updates about my research project and share relevant news and developments.  

You can find my full CV [here](/blogpics/CV_Jiaxu.pdf) (as of Oct 2024).  

I am working in the Prof. Edel Pérez López's lab ([Edelab](https://www.edelabcriv.ca/home/)), who is my PhD supervisor.
